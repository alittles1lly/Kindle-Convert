# Kindle-Convert

This Python program can be used to change the file type of eBook files. Note that to use the program Calibre (https://calibre-ebook.com/download) needs to be installed. Also to input/output KFX files you need to use the proper Calibre plugin. To install calibre plugins, you can follow this guide https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=118680. To use DRM content, you must install DeDRM which is not avaible offically through calibre and must be installed the Load plugin from file feature. Due to the nature of removing DRM, I cannot show the link here, but it is avaible in a github project.
